Asteroseismology is based on a technique which uses time series analysis to extract the frequency content of the stars. Despite its achievements, it still faces a number of open questions. The most relevant of these questions being finding the elusive g modes in the Sun.

 Here we propose an alternative approach to the detection of solar g modes by exploring a heuristic analysis. Fourier kernel is to be replaced with an appropriate phase-modified term. In order to test this conjecture we explore the application of this transform to a time series from GOLF/SoHO instrument. 
 
 The results shown here are consistent with the theoretically expected pulsation spectrum of low-degree solar p-modes. A full physical explanation for this solution and a further application for the detection of g-modes is in progress.
